# World Life Expectancy Project (Exploratory Data Analysis)

# Used dataset cleaned from previous project in this repository
# Further cleaning could be done to balance out the amount of zeroes in some of the dataset bringing down averages and increase accuracy

# Purpose of EDA to explore changes in global life expectancy over time, the correlation between GDP and Life Expectancy, and to understand other effects from variables such as status, BMI, and disease on Life Expectancy 

# Conclusion: Found a strong correlation between GDP and Life Expectancy. Life Expectancy globally has trended upwards over time, and developed nations have a much higher average life expectancy at age 79.2 whereas developing countries have an average age of 66.8. Countries in Africa have a higher average disease count and lower life expectancy.
