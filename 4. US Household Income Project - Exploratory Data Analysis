# US Household Income Project (EDA), 32500 Rows

# Using csv dataset from Analystbuilder (pulled from a US government website) containing data for various incomes in each state
# Completed on on MySQLWorkbench

# Purpose of this project is to analyze which states are the largest by land, water. Analyzing which cities and types of living communities have the highest and lowest incomes
# Performed using aggregate functions, joins, filtering

# Conclusions: Found Alaska had most land and water. Puerto Rico makes the least on average. Highest paid cities tend to be in the North East and California.
